# Multilingual user interface

Workflow looks as following:

1. Markup TSX code using `translate` function. For example:
 `translate('User details')`

1. Always mark complete sentences for translation. If you combine fragments at runtime, there is no way for the translator to construct a proper sentence in their language. Do not combine strings together at runtime.

1. If you need to render JSX element inside of translated string, you should use `formatJsxTemplate` function:

```javascript
translate('Opened by {user} at {date}', {
  user: <IssueUser item={item} />,
  date: formatDate(item.created),
}, formatJsxTemplate)
```

1. If translated string should be rendered inside of JSX element, you should use `formatJsx` function:

```javascript
translate(
  'You have not added any SSH keys to your <Link>profile</Link>.',
  { Link: (s) => <Link state="profile.keys">{s}</Link> },
  formatJsx,
)
```

1. Translation template is created automatically via Webpack. It will extract strings from TS and TSX files and put it in `locales/template.pot`.

1. PO files are synced with Localazy service by GitLab CI pipelines.

1. All PO files are automatically converted by Webpack to JSON files.

1. Current user locale is stored in auth storage.
