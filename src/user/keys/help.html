<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>
  On your machine create public and private SSH keys using the command-line:
</p>
<pre class="code">
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>
<p>
  You will be asked to confirm keys location and create passphrase to protect
  your private key:
</p>
<pre class="code">
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/b/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</pre
>
<p>
  After successful creation you should copy id_rsa.pub (your public key) content
  and paste it into "Public key" input on Add key page<br />
  For other Linux systems search instructions for your distribution.
</p>
<h3>OS X</h3>
<p>
  Instructions are pretty much the same as for Linux,<br />
  but you may omit directory creation and enter only this line
</p>
<pre class="code"> ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
  On of the possible ways to create SSH keys on Windows is using
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git Bash</a>. This set of steps is
  based this tool, you need to install it to proceed further.
</p>
<p>
  At first check if you already have public key, if so you can use it on our Add
  Key page. Open Git Bash and enter:
</p>
<pre class="code"> ls -al ~/.ssh</pre>
<p>
  This command will show existing files in your .ssh directory. Public key has
  .pub extension (usually id_rsa.pub)
</p>
<p>
  To generate new SSH key pair in your Git Bash enter:
</p>
<pre class="code"> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</pre>
<p>
  This will create new ssh key, using the provided email as a label, when you
  see information about choosing keys directory just press Enter. <br />
  You will also be asked to enter a passphrase. After all is done you will see
  output like this:
</p>
<pre class="code">
# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com</pre
>
<p>
  Next, you have to enable your ssh-agent and add keys that you have created.
  <br />
  Open your Git Bash and start the agent:
</p>
<pre class="code">
# start the ssh-agent in the background
ssh-agent - s</pre
>
<p>
  Add your SSH key to ssh-agent:
</p>
<pre class="code">ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
<p>
  That's it, you are ready to go!
</p>
